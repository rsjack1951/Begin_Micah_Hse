I'm I'm Todd Malloy, and I was a graduate of John 316 ministry. I was there a couple of years and before before moving to Fayetteville while I was still at John Tory as an instructor there were at a time there were not a lot of transition houses. And there were a lot of men that I minister to that were that not only them but me also was concerned about them going back to their their same geographic the teaching of John three, you know, you get to gospels. You have an opportunity daily to apply the Gospels to your life. And and then you also you know, one of the signs that John three was, you know, try not to go back to your same geographic and so, not really at the time, they can transitional living because at the time I was content with being at the ministry and really wasn't taking transitional living. But, one, one week we had a promotional dinner at, like, I was like two years in and or maybe not quite two years in and we had a promotional banner at Verizon Arena in Little Rock. And, and I was on that, that trip and a good friend of mine that I grew up with graduated high school. His name is Brian Brad. Brown, basically, he showed up at this event. Just out of the blue, I had no idea you know, and I asked him, I said, Why are you here and, and, and he said, Well, I'm here to see you. And he was wanting to know what my long term plan was and then ended at the time I didn't have a plan. My plan was to stay at the ministry. Until I felt like I was called away from it. We spent the evening talking and we had dinner together and and he had been watching my daughter keeping up with her on social media and we while I was into ministry we had gotten rid of just about everything and and he knew she was in Fayetteville. And so he was you know, asked me said you take you may end up in Fayetteville and I told him I said, I have no idea and he knew a pastor that he had done mission work with named Jody Farrow, and he gave me Jodi's number. He said, Look, if you, thank you, maybe going to Fayetteville. He said you need to get a hold of this guy. This guy's got a Church in South Fayetteville and so I just sat on that number for months and one day, I was off camp, and, and I reached out to Jody, I was like, I was like, you know, maybe that that was God. Speaking to me, you know, maybe I need to call this guy so I reached out to Jody, and he answered the phone and we started talking and I told him how I'd gotten his number and, and over several phone calls, over a period of probably four, maybe four to six months, he finally told me he he's like more if you if you if you come to Fayetteville, I would like for you to try our Church. And so at that point, during those conversations we had already had formed a relationship. And I was even helping him navigate already some people who were in their addiction and were seeking help. And so anyway, it got ready to exit the ministry ended up in Fayetteville showed up at Genesis Church on a Saturday for the first time and I met Susie Stewart. And in the and I thought that following week I went to CR and I had met Scott Meyer, and there's another friend of ours. His name was Todd her late and I had been I had also worked with Todd Todd was was struggling had gotten and so was trying to get him some help and so I've had several phone calls with Todd before I ever even got to Fabius, when I got to fate wheel. I was looking as when I got to Genesis I was looking for Jody, and I was looking for Todd and so that was really the the community. I was just looking for community and then I met Scott through Todd. And so we just all kind of linked up and we started sorry, they were already serving the Church. I kind of come in like two weeks, three weeks after maybe Scott and so we just started doing community together waking up doing Bible studies, meeting up into Church every day. And none of us were working. We were just serving the Church. And for about, I want to say four to seven months in there. You know going to car coming to Church serving every day. Meeting the staff and already working with the staff. Jody had had taken me out for coffee. And he he told me that there was some seed money that that they had that needed that we're looking for recovery. We had to use it for recovery only and and he was picking my brain about how we need to use that money. And so in that conversation, I immediately told him transitional living because all I can think about were those guys back at John three that didn't have a place to go. At the time I was living with my daughter and looking for community. So we we they get serious about it. We had a couple of more meetings. We got at the time it was John blue and Carolyn loan. Greg Gibson, Miss Jan Davis, Steve poor young Jody. Glenn Miller. It was a gang I was that. And also Todd and Scott that went over to Jonesborough and we visited we were gonna go visit breaking bonds. And I asked him I said since we're over there I said I can schedule maybe a visit on the same trip at John three because I wanted I want if we were gonna do transitional living, I was wanting them to say I was walking to Church to see how those men were living. And if we had an opportunity and pursued opportunity of putting something together I didn't. I wanted them to see how they were living. And to make sure that whatever we did, it was nice. I didn't I didn't feel like they should. They had already been living John three for at least six months to a year and they didn't need to transition out to anything. Any less than what they were already where you know how they were already living. I was worried about them, getting their dignity stripped from them just as soon as I left so we went and visited John Tory back breaking bonds. owned that trip made a decision that transitional living was was probably gonna be the way we're gonna go. And when we got back, we immediately formed a committee and started working on transitional living. At the time they were building the house across the street from the Church. And we were watching all of this and most had had several conversations and even comments were made. Like one where would somebody be able to be go half like that right there. You know, and so ended up after that got the House bill. They the house went on the market for rent. We went and looked at it and we started renting the Micah house
TM
Todd Mulloy
10:28
and yeah, got a first group of guys from from John three we we really didn't know what we were doing before let me back up a little bit. After we rented it. I moved in the house. And it was just me living in the house. Like Todd was living with his parents and Scott was living with his parents and Scott was struggling with going out to his mom's that was where he had done a lot of bad and it was a trigger for him. So I saying real quick that it did. I mean we were already doing life together. I didn't see any reason why we shouldn't just move on in the house. So moved him in the house with he and I were living in the house and to us Scott. Todd was basically at the house other than when he went home to sleep. He was at the house and we just continued to serve the Church. And take a mail from John three. And already have started really and truly the network. The network. Guy was building a network around the Micah Hope Ministry. before it ever even was Micah Hope Ministry before I ever even left John three. When him and Jody and I were already visiting about certain people, you know, coming to the Church to God reaching out for help and having you know, having God haven't helped with with people who were reaching out without. And so Scott Scott's formed his network, and I had a network going on and it got to where it was pretty overwhelming. I think at the time Scott, Todd was working, making pizzas and then Scott. He was trying to find him something to do so. He just started going up to the pizza joint was Todd and wasn't even getting paid and Scott was was making pizzas and he ended up going to work for them for a little while. And then as our network grew Scott became the director of the house and we started like an outreach portion, part of Micah Hope Ministry and that's that's basically it got started took her first group of men coming in and we had a bunch of rules and we had to go back and and redefined all of them and show a little bit more grace than what we originally started out with. And we've had we've had some that have done well and we've had some that didn't do so well. But over the period of five years, you know we've we've managed to be at about 68% success rate with the guys that we've taken in as I was visiting with you earlier, Scott, you know our communities what makes that Minister he had been wrapped here to Church and then guys been able to transition here. They already know when they get here, what the expectation of it of them is and we just try to surround them with good community and, and continue to, you know, share the word apply to our life and serve the Church serve the community and that's that's has become what it has today. There's a lot a lot of hands and feet that are around Micah, and I'm thankful for that.

So how did y'all pick the first people? How did you finally get up?
TM
Todd Mulloy
14:56
So, so I think we took like, we were like one of the first transition houses. John Tory, I think there were maybe there might have been four at the most the ones had that had had transition housing for them. They hadn't been like a year old. Nobody knew what they were doing. And so and and that was five years ago. Today, you know, it got up to Canada want to really say pacifically I won't I'm gonna ballpark 10 To 1210 to 14 houses. And over the last five years and then now the day I think it's back down to the maybe three and so even even with with all of the mistakes that we've made, you know, trying to build the ministry. I think we've done pretty good so, so the first guys we took I was still familiar with the residence. It was within a year of me leaving and that's what we kind of tried to depend on as the guys. You know, the last guys we've taken they're the last ones that can know more about the men and in in the ministry even though we get over there we still don't know. You know the residents like those guys like the guys that just freshly graduated they know pretty much well know everybody at the ministry. And so I felt like I felt like the ones that we took the first time I think their frustration was probably our frustration that we just didn't know what we were doing. We were taking a persona there are a couple that are still doing good. And they'd have done well. And then we've actually one of the first ones we've took, has has taken his own lives and so and so as we've as we've gone through this all the way up to like a five year you know we've been there five years. We kind of we depend on like say we met depend on the guys that that are for it, you know have come with the lightest guys out of there. We still have singer and structures instructors that we lay down for good discernment on whoever we take and and now since we've been here the ministry is coming up here from time to time on ticket trail or whether they're working and we have opportunities to go meet them and take them food and and and they can we you know have gotten guys from those groups that have come up here, and I visited our Church and see what we're doing and see what see what the ministry has done and how the ministry is fit like within our Church and it's part of our chart one of our churches ministry they see and they feel the spirit around the Church when they're here and so and then on top of that, you know, they know what we're looking for. They know the expectations when they get here they know that that they're coming here to relocate and to start a new live in a Church community. And like I didn't know what that looked like. When I when I first got here. I don't think Scott did. And I really don't think Todd did it to time but you know yeah, that's that's that's where that's where it all started and how I got started. There was a lot like say there was a lot of people who had a plaguing as I look back today. And, and and it's so funny because you know, I was telling my daughter and my brother in law, you know, and my, and my stepdad young going work for Church going to work for century United Methodist Church. My dad knew Central United Methodist Church, my brother in law used to go to Central United Methodist Church. And, and they're like, this is just another story that this this is one of many stories. This dude is dragged to sail and we're not really sure where this is going. But everybody was pretty patient. And they knew that things were different with me, but I don't think I know I sure did. And I know that she didn't think that. That God all of the things that had happened in that period of time, and I look back at how God was really working in in my life and Scott's life. I mean, just the community's life. We literally loaded everybody up on Church playing we all drove for hours four and a half hours over to Northeast Arkansas. I had no idea who was in the but who I was riding with. Didn't know Church had never blown to Church. And then and then be sitting in a table and making a decision about what we're fixing to do. None of none of the three of us had any money. You know, we were actually living man Scott and Todd were like, if I had money, they have money if they have money, we have money if to me it was just crazy. Had our work and then we're and we're end up in a big old room and off a Dickson street in a big it central hashing out and forming you know hashing out with a committee that was formed to to build a ministry in Fayetteville Arkansas, and I look back down I slide man and it's so crazy. And and I know that my you know, my family and they were like, this is just another crazy story of he is you know, and and in to see how it's come and work to come. And, and even seeing our churches going through what they went through the last couple of years. And we still have those those relationships with the churches. And, you know, the with Santro with Christ Church film and with with with first you know, first Church in Springdale and Genesis and you know just what God's doing it is, I mean, it's overwhelming. And, and even though we've made a lot of mistakes, there's a lot of good that is coming out of this ministry, and that are affecting people's lives. I mean, you know, Scott's a student Minister now. And, you know, I know Todd's faith is is is still growing today and you know, what God's doing in my life and he's still revealing stuff to me. You know, in the journey, and, you know, that path is, is, you know, trying to stay on that narrow path and all the distractions. You know, I'm, I'm proud that that I'm thankful that God's doing the work that he's doing. What's up beautiful Manchester. Like I said, it's building its building. Men who are moving forward and in the ministry word, the guys that we have now and you know, when in their heart for Jesus, you know, in our community, rally, rattling, rattling around these men, you know, that, that they're taking a chance on they're taking a chance on all of us. Praise God for you know, we've been rotating guys that we had today are great guys. You know, I know we're gonna get one there. They're gonna be one come, you know? And even we're curious, you know, what, whether it be from John three, another ministry, you know, we weren't the ones that God wants us to have, that God wants us to have. Because we, like say we've we've picked some that we wanted to have, and it didn't work out too well. So it's, it's not any particular process other than the fact that
TM
Todd Mulloy
24:52
we get, you know, we'll get a letter, we'll get a guy who's interested when we're at the ministry or if we're at another ministry and somebody is thinking about coming to five we'll, we'll just start that process and be under prayer and be you know, be prayerful about it. And yeah, what's,
SJ
Scott Jackson
25:14
what's a typical day like at the, at the house? How's it you know, just just kind of return to everybody get up or so.
TM
Todd Mulloy
25:24
So I have a six o'clock Bible study. I think I'm at like, six.
SJ
Scott Jackson
25:32
Let's just talk about when you were there. When I was
TM
Todd Mulloy
25:34
there. We had a six o'clock Bible study Monday through Friday. And then we had a seven o'clock Bible study on Saturday. And then we had Church on Sunday. And, you know, you know, you go to work, you come in, you know, and you just do life together. You get up in the Word. You leave the house. You apply to your life. In different different residents are leaving for the day and building different relationships. At the end of the day, we're coming back at same table that we started out that we started out around. We have great big, beautiful table in the Micah house which makes the Micah house and that's where buy stuff is everybody has a designated seat around the table. I think there's like 12 to 12 chairs. And so each man Each day a different guy would lead to Bible study. And I mean, when you first walk in the house, that's the first thing you're gonna see is that is that big O table in the Bibles. We get you know, I got some guys that are pretty deep in the Word. I mean, they're, they were taught by good teachers. And John three and are wherever they were at and go to work they come back a lot of them come over to the Church and hang out to see what the staff is doing. It's it's it's, they're basically own staff at the Church. The Church the the community depends on there's always somebody knocking on the front door Nathan Hale.
SJ
Scott Jackson
27:25
Whatever Micah house, it to Micah house,
TM
Todd Mulloy
27:27
there's, you know, there's always unsheltered that are holding a cigarette or something to drink or peanut butter and jelly sandwich are and and they know when they become a resident of that house, that that is going to happen. And that's just that's what has formed and and as it's grown, it's debated and people know the guys and the Micah house and they know what, what their mission is to help co you know any kind of special advantage Church they're involved in and most of them every Sunday, they have a responsibility at the Church. They are put on task, they know their task. And, and I mean, they're just they're just part of the community. And the beautiful part is is the community has accepted us right where we're at when we show up. And there are some deep relationships that have been built between the men and the community. You know, on Fridays we have a man up Bible study, which is a men's group, not necessarily at our Church, but that come and we made him fellowship at six o'clock on on Friday morning, and then that we do our Bible study we all go to to the Olympian and have breakfast together and just, you know, continue to further that, you know, build those relationships. And I think that's what it's the community that makes that makes Micah Hope Ministry in the me, those of the most important those men are the most important part of our Church. They they fill in the gaps at Genesis. They know when they get here that that's, that's what they're looking at. You know, we're we're in Washington County and they're they're all either sovereign or Church or sovereign and sovereign. In another Church community and it's just it's beautiful to watch everybody's work together. The Vance everybody just working together. You may come in and there may be three man on the couch and one in the floor. And somebody's laying in a recliner after work. You know, but the relationships are close and and got a lot of depth to
SJ
Scott Jackson
30:36
see Yeah, what are the expectations when you're in the in the house you have responsibilities that you have associated with the house so
TM
Todd Mulloy
30:47
so they're they're had their their house? duties. And everybody the house is expected to two story house with, I think six bedrooms and three baths. They're small
TM
Todd Mulloy
31:05
and, but they have they do have responsibilities, whether it be sweeping downstairs upstairs cleaning toilets, cleaning bathrooms, kitchen duty kitchen, everybody, I think I think each day each resident has, you know, has a day that that they have to clean the kitchen. Trash have to take out the trash and when I was there, I couldn't believe how much trash we were building up in there but at least twice a day. For is like, like the food and stuff like the food and stuff. Yeah, the community is always bringing food into house. I know. It's been fun watching them do the Keto to house and now like each one's preparing the different foods and stuff but just like everybody else I like to eat out. You know? But they do sit down together from time to time and have a meal or or have you know, a family bring some food. It's easy. It's just beautiful. I mean, to where they were, they were where we once were and where we are today. It's just like I mean, it's just Jesus. I mean, it is very powerful. In the watch, to watch God continue to work in their lives. You know the relationships that have been rekindled with their families. We got two guys in the house right now they get their sons every other weekend. That's absolutely insane. Court says no. But even their wives even their their ex wives or their their mamas have their babies say the difference in the change in their to allow that to happen. You know, and most of them have been to visit the community. Being in charge seeing the scene our Church members and there's one thing about it you know, if you come to Genesis you're going to know everybody cuz we're going to make sure that you get introduced everybody that's that's in our community.

In our individual they'll step up and pay their first month's rent. When they come in, they gotta they have to, you know, they know they got to work.

He was my Bible instructor he's like, you know, I told me he said more your your I can see your good old guy, you know, but when you leave here, you gotta be that guy. And so I chat I challenge the guys to be those guys in our community. Oh, those are the mica guys. And when I say that not boasting I mean we gotta be those guys for Jesus. And we have been blessed. I think we know we started out with 150,000 I know we have over 100,000 The day five years later and in the account, the Micah account and we have purchased our house. I think we owe a little bit and that's just the community. I mean, that's Jesus I mean, cuz I sure didn't have anything I had a bunch of debt. But so we're just gonna continue to pick up here man. Man
